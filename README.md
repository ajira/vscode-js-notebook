# JS Notebook

Runs a .jsnb file in a node process with the directory of the file as the working directory.
(A .jsnb file is just a .js file renamed so that this extension opens it as a notebook by default)

**TIP**: Use `var` instead of `let` or `const` for the variables in notebook in case you plan to run it more than once
